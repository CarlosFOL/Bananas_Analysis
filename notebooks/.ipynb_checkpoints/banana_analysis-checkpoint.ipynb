    "* Quality Score: A numerical score, likely on a scale of 1-4 that rates the overall quality of the banana sample\n",
    "* Variety: It refers to banana's type.\n",
    "* Ripeness: How ripeness the banana is.\n",
    "* Sugar Content Brix: Amount of sugar measured in degrees Brix.\n",
    "* Firmness (kgf): It's associated with th texture of the banana (hard or soft).\n",
    "* Tree age: The age of the banana tree.\n",
    "* Altitude: It's the altitude at which bananas plants are growing, measured in meter above the sea. There are bananas that grow better in a certain altitude and conditions that others.\n",
    "* Rainfall (mm): Amount of rainfall in the zone where the bananas were harvested. A higher amount of rainfall may indicate favorable growing conditions for bananas.\n",
    "* Soil nitrogen: Measured in part per million (ppm). It's the concentration of nitrogen in the soil where the bananas were harvested. This variable is a crucial nutrient for plant growth.\n"
